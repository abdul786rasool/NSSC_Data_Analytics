# Overview
This project aims to develop a highly accurate classification model to predict the habitability of exoplanets based on a dataset of exoplanet features. By leveraging advanced data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and model tuning techniques, the model achieves excellent predictive performance.

# Key Features

**Data Analysis & Visualization:** Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for in-depth data visualization (scatter plots, density plots) to identify patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Addressed missing values, applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical features, and normalized features with Min-Max Scaler.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduced 6,000 features to 10 key features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for optimized efficiency.
Classification Model: Developed an XGBoost model with grid search hyperparameter tuning, achieving a ROC AUC score of 0.99 in habitability classification.
